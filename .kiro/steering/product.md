# Product Overview

COBRA (COBOL Banking Resilience Agent) is an agentic AI orchestration system that bridges legacy COBOL banking systems with modern AWS cloud infrastructure. The system enables incremental modernization by parsing COBOL source code, generating natural-language specifications, and creating secure API wrappers without requiring complete system rewrites.

## Core Capabilities

- Parse COBOL source files and generate Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Extract business logic patterns including interest calculations, batch processing, and transaction validations
- Generate natural-language explanations of COBOL programs
- Create AWS Lambda wrapper code that replicates COBOL business logic
- Scaffold hybrid deployment architectures connecting mainframe systems to AWS services
- Provide MCP-based agents for interactive COBOL analysis through Kiro
- Generate Kiro spec documents (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) from COBOL analysis

## Target Users

- Banking IT architects evaluating legacy systems
- Modernization engineers building cloud integrations
- Compliance officers ensuring regulatory standards
- System integrators connecting mainframe to cloud
- Development teams following structured modernization processes

## Key Principles

- Incremental modernization over complete rewrites
- Security and compliance by default
- Maintain mainframe systems while exposing functionality through modern APIs
- AI-assisted analysis and code generation
- Structured spec-driven development workflow
